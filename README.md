# Brainwave-Enabled-Random-PIN-digital-locking-system-using-Morse-Code
This is a  morse code based brain wave enabled random PIN locking system using Arduino Nano and Mindwave Mobile 2. This Project mainly depends on EEG waves and Eyeblink Detection. In this project, The RAW-EEG Data from the forehead is transferred to the Arduino Via Bluetooth with the help of Mindwave Mobile 2 . Arduino averages the data and compares it with the threshold eyeblink value. based on these comparisions eyeblinks are detected and a binary sring is developed based on these comparisions. this string controls the lock circuit. at the time of opening the locker the string also contains the PIN in binary format and it compares the string part with the stored PIN. At the time of closia new PIN is generated randomly and stroed in Morse Encryption.
